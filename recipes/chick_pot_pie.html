    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>

      <li>1/2 cup chopped red onion</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>

      <li>3-1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>

      <li>1-1/2 cups Swanson® Unsalted Chicken Stock</li>

      <li>2 cups baby kale, roughly chopped</li>

      <li>1 (15.5 ounce) can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed</li>

      <li>2 cups cubed, cooked chicken</li>

      <li>3 medium (blank)s roma (plum) tomatoes, seeded and chopped</li>

      <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>

      <li>1/2 teaspoon dried basil</li>

      <li>1 pinch salt and pepper to taste</li>

      <li>1 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly oil a deep, round
        baking dish.
      </li>

      <li>
        Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and
        cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook
        for one minute. Sprinkle the flour into the saucepan; cook and stir
        until mixture darkens slightly, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the Swanson®
        Unsalted Chicken Stock. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat; reduce
        heat to medium. Cook and stir until mixture thickens, about 3 minutes.
      </li>

      <li>
        Stir in baby kale; cook until wilted. Add the cannellini beans, chicken,
        and plum tomatoes; stir. Season with oregano, basil, salt and pepper to
        taste. Pour mixture into prepared baking dish.
      </li>

      <li>
        Place pie crust on top of the chicken mixture. Tuck under or trim edges
        that extend over the sides. Make several slits in the crust with the tip
        of a sharp knife to allow steam to escape.
      </li>

      <li>
        Bake in preheat oven until crust has browned and mixture is bubbly,
        about 30 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
