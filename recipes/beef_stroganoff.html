    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed</li>

      <li>1 pound ground sirloin</li>

      <li>3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>

      <li>1 egg</li>

      <li>1/3 cup dry bread crumbs</li>

      <li>1/2 small onion, chopped</li>

      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>

      <li>1/4 cup butter, divided</li>

      <li>1 (16 ounce) package mushrooms, sliced</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>

      <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can beef broth</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon ground mustard</li>

      <li>1/3 cup sour cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a baking sheet
        with oil.
      </li>

      <li>
        Combine ground sirloin, Worcestershire sauce, egg, bread crumbs, onion,
        salt, and pepper in a bowl. Mix well. Divide into golf ball-sized
        meatballs. Place on the prepared baking sheet.
      </li>

      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are no longer pink in the
        center, about 15 minutes.
      </li>

      <li>
        Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add
        mushrooms; cook and stir until soft, about 10 minutes. Push mushrooms to
        the side of the pan.
      </li>

      <li>
        Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in the skillet; whisk in flour. Add
        broth and mustard; bring to a boil. Add meatballs and cook until some
        sauce is absorbed, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat. Add sour cream
        and stir to combine.
      </li>
